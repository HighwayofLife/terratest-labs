## III. Golang Basics

### A. Variables and data types

   1. Golang supports various data types such as integers, floating-point numbers, strings, and booleans.
   2. Variables are declared using the `var` keyword, followed by the variable name and the data type.
   3. Variables can also be declared using the short variable declaration (`:=`) syntax, which infers the data type from the assigned value.
   

### B. Functions

   1. Functions are blocks of code that can be defined and called by name, allowing for code reuse and modularity.
   2. Functions are declared using the `func` keyword, followed by the function name, parameters, and return types.
   3. Functions can return multiple values, which can be useful for returning both a result and an error.


### C. Control structures (if, for, switch)

   1. `if` statements are used for conditional branching based on the evaluation of an expression.
   2. `for` loops are used for iterating over a range of values, or until a certain condition is met.
   3. `switch` statements are used to execute different blocks of code based on the value of an expression.

### D. Packages and imports
Packages and imports help you to structure your Go code and reuse functionality from other packages, leading to more organized and maintainable code.

   1. Packages are a way of organizing and reusing code in Golang, allowing you to group related functions, variables, and types.
   2. The `package` keyword is used to declare the package name at the beginning of a Go source file.
   3. To use functions or variables from another package, you need to import the package using the `import` keyword and provide the package's import path.
   4. The `main` package and function serve as the entry point for your Go program.

### E. Error handling
   1. Golang uses a unique approach to error handling that involves returning error values from functions.
   2. The `error` type is a built-in interface used to represent error conditions in Go.
   3. Functions that can encounter errors typically return an error as the last return value.
   4. Error handling is typically done by checking if the returned error value is `nil`. If it is not `nil`, an error has occurred, and appropriate action should be taken (e.g., logging the error, returning it to the caller, or terminating the program).
